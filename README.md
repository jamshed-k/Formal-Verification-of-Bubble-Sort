# Formal Verification of the Correctness of a Bubble Sort Implementation Using Coq

The bubble sort algorithm has been implemented in a functional manner. Then the correctness of the implementation has been formally verified using Coq. Particularly, the files `Perm.v` and `BubbleSort.v` is pertinent to the proposal, and the other `.v` files are preparatory materials used along the way for learning purposes.
